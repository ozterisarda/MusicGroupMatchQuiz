# MusicGroupMatchQuiz

A simple, entirely handwritten command-line Python quiz that matches user preferences to a music group. Developed as a foundational learning project.



\# 🎵 MusicGroupMatchQuiz



This is an \*\*entirely handwritten, foundational learning project\*\* developed in Python. It serves to showcase basic programming proficiency including control flow, function usage, data handling with dictionaries, and interaction with system libraries (`webbrowser`).



The application runs a personality quiz matching the user's preferences (favorite color, animal, dessert type, and season) to one of several music groups.



\## ✨ Project Highlights



\* \*\*Handwritten Code:\*\* The entire logic and structure were written from scratch, emphasizing core programming fundamentals.

\* \*\*Interactive CLI:\*\* Engages the user with a series of simple questions via the command line.

\* \*\*Score-Based Matching:\*\* Uses a custom points system to calculate the best music group match.

\* \*\*Web Integration:\*\* Automatically opens a dedicated YouTube music video link for the matched group using the `webbrowser` library.



\## 💡 Development \& Future Scope



This project is a strong starting point and offers significant room for improvement, such as:



1\.  \*\*Code Refactoring:\*\* Replacing chained `if/elif` statements with more scalable, data-driven structures (e.g., using \*\*Pandas\*\* or a structured data file like \*\*JSON/CSV\*\*).

2\.  \*\*Robust Error Handling:\*\* Implementing structured error handling (using `try/except` and better input validation loops).

3\.  \*\*Genre Expansion:\*\* Broadening the list of artists to include diverse genres beyond the initial rock/pop focus.

4\.  \*\*OOP Implementation:\*\* Restructuring the code using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.



\## 🛠️ Technologies Used



\* Python 3

\* `webbrowser` library (Standard Python library)



\## 🚀 How to Run



\### Prerequisites



You need to have Python installed on your system.



\### Steps



1\.  \*\*Clone the Repository\*\*

&nbsp;   ```bash

&nbsp;   git clone \[https://github.com/ozterisarda/MusicGroupMatchQuiz.git](https://github.com/ozterisarda/MusicGroupMatchQuiz.git)

&nbsp;   cd MusicGroupMatchQuiz

&nbsp;   ```



2\.  \*\*Execute the Script\*\*

&nbsp;   ```bash

&nbsp;   python quiz\_script\_name.py 

&nbsp;   # Replace 'quiz\_script\_name.py' with the actual file name of your quiz code

&nbsp;   ```



3\.  \*\*Follow the Prompts\*\*

&nbsp;   The quiz will prompt you to answer the questions in \*\*English\*\*. If you accept the final prompt, the corresponding YouTube video will open in your default browser.
